    <h1>Laihe Baijiu Emotional Flash Card Images</h1>
    <p>This document describes the four placeholder images needed for the emotional flash card component.</p>

    <div class="image-description">
        <h2>1. social-awkward.webp</h2>
        <h3>Scene: Social Awkwardness</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A dimly lit business dinner scene where several people are seated around a table. The atmosphere looks tense and uncomfortable, with some people looking down at their phones instead of engaging in conversation. The color palette should be cooler tones to convey the awkward mood.</p>
        <p><strong>Text Overlay:</strong> "又是一桌无言的觥筹"</p>
        <p class="emotion">Emotion: Awkwardness, discomfort, social anxiety</p>
        <p class="caption">This image should represent the pain point of awkward social gatherings where meaningful connection is absent.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-description">
        <h2>2. gift-forgotten.webp</h2>
        <h3>Scene: Forgotten Gifts</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> An office corner with a pile of similar-looking gift boxes stacked or partially forgotten. Some boxes may have dust or appear to be set aside. The scene should convey that these thoughtful gifts have lost their meaning and are now just items taking up space.</p>
        <p><strong>Text Overlay:</strong> "精心准备的心意，转眼就被遗忘"</p>
        <p class="emotion">Emotion: Disappointment, unappreciated effort</p>
        <p class="caption">This image should evoke the feeling of putting effort into selecting gifts that ultimately don't leave a lasting impression.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-description">
        <h2>3. social-discovery.webp</h2>
        <h3>Scene: Social Discovery</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A warm, elegantly lit dinner scene where people are engaged in animated conversation. The focal point should be two people examining and appreciating an elegant Laihe Baijiu bottle with its distinctive seal cap. Their faces should show genuine interest and connection.</p>
        <p><strong>Text Overlay:</strong> "原来，分享故事如此自然"</p>
        <p class="emotion">Emotion: Discovery, connection, warmth</p>
        <p class="caption">This image should represent the turning point where social barriers are broken and meaningful connections begin to form.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-description">
        <h2>4. social-memorable.webp</h2>
        <h3>Scene: Memorable Moment</h3>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> A celebration scene with warm lighting where people are genuinely enjoying each other's company. The Laihe Baijiu bottle should be prominently featured on the table, possibly with the seal impression visible nearby, symbolizing that the moment has been "sealed" in memory.</p>
        <p><strong>Text Overlay:</strong> "这一刻，永远被铭记"</p>
        <p class="emotion">Emotion: Joy, fulfillment, belonging</p>
        <p class="caption">This image should represent the final emotional state after the product has facilitated meaningful connections and created memorable moments.</p>
